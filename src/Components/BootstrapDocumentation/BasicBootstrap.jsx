        {/* {/* Question 3 */}

        <Paragraph>03. Explain the grid system in Bootstrap. How many columns does it have, and how does it work? </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph type="answer">
                The Bootstrap grid system is a flexible layout system based on a 12-column structure. It allows you to create responsive layouts by dividing the page into rows and columns.
                <Paragraph type="para">Key Features:</Paragraph>
                <ul className="px-4 list-disc list-inside">
                <li>12 Columns: The grid is divided into 12 equal columns, and you can span any number of columns (e.g., col-6 spans 6 out of 12 columns).</li>
                <li>Responsive Classes: Breakpoints (xs, sm, md, lg, xl, xxl) enable layouts to adapt to different screen sizes.</li>
                <li>Nested Grids: Columns can contain rows and columns for more complex layouts.</li>
                <li>Auto Layout: Columns adjust size automatically if no width is specified.</li>
                <li>Gutters: Space between columns can be adjusted or removed using utility classes like .g-0.</li>
            </ul>
            Example:
            <div className="  px-0 sm:px-2 md:px-8 rounded-md">
                  <CodeHighlighter code={Gridsystem} language="css" />
                  This divides the row into three equal columns.
                </div>

        </Paragraph> <br />

        {/* {/* Question 4 */}

        <Paragraph>04. What are Bootstrap containers, and whatâ€™s the difference between .container and .container-fluid? </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph type="answer">
                In Bootstrap, containers are layout wrappers used to center and align content.
                <Paragraph type="para">Types of Containers:</Paragraph>
                1. .container:
                <ul className="px-4 list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Provides a fixed-width layout based on responsive breakpoints (e.g., sm, md, lg).</li>
                <li>Content width adjusts at each breakpoint (e.g., 540px for sm, 720px for md).</li>
                <li>Use Case: Centered, fixed-width layouts.</li>
            </ul>
            2. .container-fluid:
                <ul className="px-4 list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Provides a full-width layout that spans the entire viewport width, regardless of screen size.</li>
                <li>Use Case: Full-width layouts or when working with content that needs to stretch across the page.</li>
            </ul>
            <Paragraph type="para">Example:</Paragraph>
            <div className="  px-0 sm:px-2 md:px-8 rounded-md">
                  <CodeHighlighter code={containerfluid} language="html" />
                  This divides the row into three equal columns.
                </div>

         {/* {/* Question 6 */}

         <Paragraph>06. Explain the concept of responsive design in Bootstrap. </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph type="answer">
                Responsive design in Bootstrap ensures that web pages adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices. It uses a mobile-first approach, meaning styles are applied to smaller screens by default and adjusted for larger screens using breakpoints.
                <Paragraph type="para">Key Features:</Paragraph>
                <ul className="px-4 list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Grid System: A 12-column grid with responsive classes (e.g., col-sm-6) adjusts layouts for various screen sizes.</li>
                <li>Breakpoints: Predefined screen size categories (xs, sm, md, lg, xl, xxl) for applying styles conditionally.</li>
                <li>Utility Classes: Responsive utilities (e.g., d-none, text-center) show, hide, or style elements based on screen size.</li>
                <li>Components: Many Bootstrap components, like navigation bars, are built to respond dynamically to different devices.</li>
            </ul>
            <Paragraph type="para">Example:</Paragraph>
            <div className="  px-0 sm:px-2 md:px-8 rounded-md">
                  <CodeHighlighter code={Bootstrapensures} language="html" />
                  This divides the content into two columns on medium+ screens but stacks them on smaller screens.
                </div>
        </Paragraph> <br />

        {/* {/* Question 7 */}

        <Paragraph>07. How do breakpoints work in Bootstrap? List some commonly used breakpoints. </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph type="answer">
                Breakpoints in Bootstrap are predefined screen width thresholds that allow developers to create responsive designs by applying different styles or layouts for specific device sizes. They work by using media queries to target these widths.
                <Paragraph type="para">Commonly Used Breakpoints:</Paragraph>
                <ul className="px-4 list-disc list-inside">
                <li>xs (Extra small): &lt;576px (Default for smaller screens, no explicit class needed).</li>
                <li>sm (Small): â‰¥576px (e.g., col-sm-6).</li>
                <li>md (Medium): â‰¥768px (e.g., col-md-4).</li>
                <li>lg (Large): â‰¥992px (e.g., col-lg-3).</li>
                <li>xl (Extra large): â‰¥1200px (e.g., col-xl-2).</li>
                <li>xxl (Extra extra large): â‰¥1400px (e.g., col-xxl-1).</li>
            </ul>
            <Paragraph type="para">How They Work:</Paragraph>
            <ul className="px-4 list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Responsive classes (e.g., col-sm-6, d-lg-none) apply styles starting from the specified breakpoint and up.</li>
                <li>Breakpoints allow layouts to adapt dynamically to various screen sizes.</li>
            </ul>
            <Paragraph type="para">Example:</Paragraph>
            <div className="  px-0 sm:px-2 md:px-8 rounded-md">
                  <CodeHighlighter code={BreakpointsBootstrap} language="html" />
                  This column takes full width on small screens, half width on medium screens, and one-third width on large screens.
                </div>
        </Paragraph> <br />

        {/* {/* Question 8 */}
