        {/* {/* Question 36 */}

        <Paragraph>36. What are React portals, and when should you use them?  </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph type="answer">
                React portals provide a way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the hierarchy of the parent component. This can be especially useful for certain scenarios where you need to break out of the typical parent-child hierarchy for rendering.
                <Paragraph type="para">How React Portals Work:</Paragraph>
                ðŸ”¹Creating a Portal: You use the ReactDOM.createPortal method to create a portal. This method takes two arguments: the JSX you want to render and the DOM node you want to render it into.
                <div className="  px-0 sm:px-2 md:px-8 rounded-md">
                    <CodeHighlighter code={ReactPortals} language="javascript" />
                </div>
                In this example, the content of PortalComponent will be rendered inside the DOM element with the ID portal-root, which is outside the usual React component hierarchy.
                <Paragraph type="para">When to Use React Portals:</Paragraph>
                ðŸ”¹Modals and Dialogs: Portals are commonly used to render modals, dialogs, or popups. These elements need to appear above the main application content and often need to escape the parent component's CSS styling and layout.
                <div className="  px-0 sm:px-2 md:px-8 rounded-md">
                    <CodeHighlighter code={UseReactPortals} language="javascript" />
                </div>
                ðŸ”¹Tooltips and Popovers: Similar to modals, tooltips and popovers often need to be rendered outside the normal parent component hierarchy to avoid clipping and positioning issues. <br />
                ðŸ”¹Fixed Position Elements: Elements that need to be fixed in place, regardless of scroll or layout changes, can benefit from being rendered in a portal. <br />
                ðŸ”¹Avoiding Overflow and Z-Index Issues: Rendering elements outside their parent components can help avoid issues related to CSS overflow and z-index stacking contexts.
                <Paragraph type="para">Key Points:</Paragraph>
                ðŸ”¹Isolation: Portals allow you to render elements in a different part of the DOM while keeping them logically associated with their parent component. <br />
                ðŸ”¹Event Bubbling: Even though the portal content is rendered outside the parent hierarchy, events within the portal still bubble up through the React component tree as if they were in the original hierarchy. <br />
                ðŸ”¹Flexibility: Portals provide a flexible way to manage complex UI structures, especially for elements that need to overlay other content. <br />
                React portals are a powerful tool for creating complex and interactive UI elements that need to escape the constraints of the parent component hierarchy, making them ideal for modals, tooltips, and other overlay elements.

        {/* {/* Question 40 */}

        <Paragraph>40. What is Concurrent Mode in React, and what are its benefits?  </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph type="answer">
                Concurrent Mode in React is a set of new features that help React apps stay responsive and gracefully adjust to the user's device capabilities and network speed. It allows React to work on multiple tasks at the same time, pausing and resuming them as needed.
                <Paragraph type="para">Benefits:</Paragraph>
                ðŸ”¹Improved User Experience: Keeps the app responsive even during heavy computations.<br />

        {/* {/* Question 41 */}

        <Paragraph>41. How do you implement Error Boundaries in React?  </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph type="answer">
                Error Boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed. They help prevent the entire application from crashing due to errors in a single component.

                ðŸ”¹Virtual Representation: React creates a virtual copy of the DOM.<br />
                ðŸ”¹Diffing Algorithm: When a component's state or props change, React updates the Virtual DOM first.<br />
                ðŸ”¹Reconciliation: React compares (diffs) the new Virtual DOM with the previous one to identify changes. <br />
                ðŸ”¹Minimal Updates: Only the changed parts are updated in the actual DOM, minimizing reflows and repaints.
                <Paragraph type="para">Benefits:</Paragraph>
                ðŸ”¹Performance: Reduces the number of direct DOM manipulations, improving performance.<br />
                ðŸ”¹Efficiency: Ensures that updates are minimal and optimized.

        <Paragraph>51. How does Reactâ€™s reconciliation algorithm work?</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph type="answer">
                Reactâ€™s Reconciliation Algorithm is a process that determines how the Virtual DOM updates the actual DOM to ensure optimal performance and minimal updates.
                <Paragraph type="para">How It Works:</Paragraph>
                ðŸ”¹Diffing: React compares the new Virtual DOM tree with the previous one to identify changes.<br />
                ðŸ”¹Element Types: If elements are of different types (e.g., &LT;div&GT; vs &LT;span&GT;), React re-renders the entire subtree.<br />
                ðŸ”¹Keys: For lists, React uses keys to track items and efficiently update them, minimizing reordering.<br />
                ðŸ”¹Minimal Updates: Only the nodes that have changed are updated in the actual DOM.
                <Paragraph type="para">Benefits:</Paragraph>
